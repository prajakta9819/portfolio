                I'm a Software QA Engineer with a passion for ensuring software excellence. My journey in quality 
                assurance has been driven by attention to detail and a commitment to delivering bug-free, 
                high-performance applications.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  I believe quality assurance is more than just identifying bugsâ€”it's about advocating for the user, 
                  anticipating edge cases, and ensuring secure, performant, and seamless user experiences. From mobile 
                  apps and web platforms to backend systems, I've executed API, performance, security, and functional 
                  testing using tools like Selenium, Cypress, and Rest Assured.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                My background includes Agile team leadership, and collaboration with cross-functional stakeholders 
                to ensure quality at every stage. Whether testing NFT marketplaces, mobile apps, or finance systems, 
                my focus remains the same: to deliver reliable, user-centered software through continuous improvement 
                and process excellence.
